# scope , hoisting, and other behaviours

## execution context

## scope refers to the particular variables that are available at that part of the code.

## research lexical scoping vs dynamic scoping

## let const have block scope 

## var has function scope but is not available on higher layers than it is declared

## be sure to always declare variables as simply assigning them adds them to the global scope

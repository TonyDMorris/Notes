# scope , hoisting, and other behaviours
## lexical scope we go back to where it is declared in  the code
## execution context

## scope refers to the particular variables that are available at that part of the code.

## research lexical scoping vs dynamic scoping

## let const have block scope 

## var has function scope but is not available on higher layers than it is declared

## be sure to always declare variables as simply assigning them adds them to the global scope
{
## closures
this is when a function knows what variables it has access to even if it doesnt currently have access to it.
#cove
## closed over variable environment
}
## higher order functions
## ...args in a function paramter will add all arguements
## then we can retreive them with ...args when we call the function

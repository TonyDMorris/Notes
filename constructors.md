# constructors

- create objects diffrently to factory functions

- this is not explicitly bound to the object and there is no return statment

## constructor funcs by default 
- create a new object
- bind 'this' to that object
- return that object

- use the new syntax to create a new instance of the constructor

- can use the instanceOf to check if the returned obj is an instance of the parent object

- dunder proto

- the constructor has a prototype property that can be used to bind functions

```js
pPizza.prototype.inspect = function

```

# OOP + Factory functions + This

## this is a placeholder for the context in which you are calling the function

- this is called implicit binding (bound to the object calling it)

##  default binding 
- if no context given this is assigned to global object

## explicit binding

- we use call and bind

### function.call(thisObjectName, args)

### function.apply(thisObjectName, [array of arggs])

### const var = function.bind(userObject)

- creates a variable bount tot he passed object

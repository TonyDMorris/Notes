# `this` and Object-Oriented Programming

## Prior Knowledge

- Assigning and updating properties on an object
- Behaviours of scope
- References vs values of objects

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the sprint you should:

- Understand basic distinction between Functional Programming and Object-Oriented Programming
- Be able to create a factory function
- Be able to use `this` where appropriate
- Understand difference between implicit, explicit, and default binding to `this`.

## Programming Paradigms: Functional Programming vs Object-Oriented Programming

A programming paradigm is just another way of saying 'a style of programming'.

Up until this point, you've mainly been writing JavaScript using a Functional Programming (FP) Paradigm, perhaps even without realising. This means that we're writing JS in a style that focusses on functions, and strives to make these functions 'pure'.

Among other things, a 'pure' function is one that:

- avoids mutation: e.g if the function is passed an array, it will return a new array with the relevant changes rather than the same array mutated.

- has a consistent output for input: e.g. if a function invoked multiple times with the same input, the output will always be the same. This allows us to confidently carry out testing - we know what we want to always get as an output based on a test input.

We are now going to look at a different style of programming: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

OOP exploits the fact that objects in JavaScript can hold data in properties and hold 'behaviours' (functions) as methods. The `izzisAccount` object below holds the data of the user's `username` and `basket`, and also has a method `addToBasket` that adds an item to the `basket` array.

```js
const izzisAccount = {
  username: 'izzi',
  basket: [],
  addToBasket: function(item) {
    izzisAccount.basket.push(item);
  },
};
```

## Factory Functions

If we want to create lots of objects that all have the same basic blueprint, we can create a factory function. This function can return a new object every time its called, where each one is initialised with the same template.

```js
function createUser(name) {
  const newUser = {};
  newUser.username = name;
  newUser.basket = [];
  newUser.addToBasket = function(item) {
    newUser.basket.push(item);
  };
  return newUser;
}

const izzisAccount = createUser('Izzi');
const anatsAccount = createUser('Anat');
```

Every user object created using the function above will be initialised with a key of `name`, `basket` (which is an empty array) and `addToBasket`. When `addToBasket` is invoked with an item it will update the user object's basket with the new item.

The problem is that every time we create a new user, we also create an entirely new function every time, each with a different reference in memory. This very quickly gets unsustainable.

```js
console.log(izzisAccount.addToBasket === anatsAccount.addToBasket); // FALSE
```

The solution is to bring this method outside the scope of the factory function itself:

```js
function createUser(name) {
  const newUser = {};
  newUser.username = name;
  newUser.basket = [];
  newUser.addToBasket = addToBasket;
  return newUser;
}

function addToBasket(item) {
  newUser.basket.push(item); // gives ReferenceError: newUser is not defined
}
```

We no longer have reference to what object `newUser` is referring to now, which is where `this` comes in...

## This

## Implicit Binding

We can replace `newUser` with `this`, which represents the **context** of the function. Whenever a function is called as a method of an object, the `this` inside of it gets implicitly bound to whatever object is calling the function (i.e. the object left of the dot).

```js
function addToBasket(item) {
  this.basket.push(item);
}

izzisAccount.addToBasket('sandwiches');
```

In the example above, `izzisAccount` is the 'owner' of the function `addToBasket`, so any occurences of `this` within that function act as placeholders for the `izzisAccount` object.

## Explicit Binding

We can call and explicitly set the value of this of a function call by using the function methods call and apply.

```js
addToBasket.call(izzi, 'sandwiches');
addToBasket.apply(izzi, ['sandwiches']);
```

Both of the above invoke the function `addToBasket`, setting the value of `this` to be izzi. The difference between `call` and `apply` is only in how you pass in arguments to `addToBasket` - `call` takes multiple arguments, whereas `apply` takes an array of arguments.

Another method available is `bind`.

```js
const addToIzzisBasket = addToBasket.bind(izzi);
```

Invoking bind returns a new function - in the example above, it returns a copy of `addToBasket` where the value of `this` is **always** going to be the `izzi` object. A bound function cannot have the `this` value changed.

## Default Binding

If we call a function containing the `this` keyword without providing any context then `this` will get its value by 'default binding'. This means that it will bind to the `global` object (which is the `window` if you do this in the browser). This can be dangerous as we can accidentally start adding keys and values to the `global` - this is the case in code below, which adds the key of 'favouriteAnimal' and value of 'Hedgehog' to the global object.

```js
function addFavouriteAnimal(animal) {
  this.favouriteAnimal = animal;
}

addFavouriteAnimal('Hedgehog');
console.log(global);
```

The console.log(global) would show the entire global object with a key of favouriteAnimal and a value of "Hedgehog"!

## Arrow Function Behaviour

ES6 Arrow functions don't create their own value of `this`, they use the value of `this` of the enclosing execution context.

This makes arrow functions not well suited for object methods.

You can think of it as: arrow functions carry over the value of `this` immediately outside of them.

```js
// our user factory function
function createUser (name, yearOfBirth) {
  return {
    name,
    yearOfBirth,
    sayName: userMethods.sayName,
    sayAge: userMethods.sayAge
  };
}

const userMethods = {
  sayName: () => {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
  sayAge: () => {
    console.log(`I'm ${2017 - this.yearOfBirth} years old`);
  }
};

// creating an instance of our "cookie cutter" object
const mauro = createUser('Mauro', 1989);
const sam = createUser('Sam', 1987);

mauro.sayName();  // "Hello, my name is undefined"
sam.sayName();  // "Hello, my name is undefined"

mauro.sayAge();  // "I'm undefined years old"
sam.sayAge();  // "I'm undefined years old"
```
